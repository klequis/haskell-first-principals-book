Today I sucessfully converted an Express server from plain JavaScript to TypeScript + Purify TS

I started with a only moderate understanding of TypeScript so had to lear a lot more.

I had a good understanding of FP principals, I could use Maybe & Either, but I didn't really understand it. So when I tried to incorporate Purify TS I got bogged-down.

I have been through many blogs and some books on FP in JS. They all seem to dive into explaining what a functor is and making your own versions of Maybe & Either. There is a lot of good learning there but, when making use of Maybe & Either I still felt I was making use of patterns I saw in examples and didn't fully get the larger picture.

All along I wondered if it were necessary to learn a FP language to fully understand FP. After getting fustrated with FP in the context of JS I decided to learn Haskell.

Why Haskell? Haskell is fully / purely a function language. There is not escape hatch or exceptions. It also has a good community and an abundance of learning resources.
