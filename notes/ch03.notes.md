## Single vs Double Quoted Characters

> The way the text reads, 'c' is a character & "cat" is a string.

> `String` is _type alias_ or synonym for a list of `Char`

Double quotes on a signle character produce a list

```haskell
"H" :: [Char]
```

Double quotes on a string of characters also produces a list

```haskell
:t "Hello"
"Hello" :: [Char]
```

Single quotes produce a single character Char (not a list)

```haskell
'H' :: Char
```

Single quotes on a string of characters produces an error

```haskell
:t 'Hello'

{-- <interactive>:1:1: error:
    • Syntax error on 'Hello'
      Perhaps you intended to use TemplateHaskell or TemplateHaskellQuotes
    • In the Template Haskell quotation 'Hello' --}
```

## `main` in a Module

When building a project with Stack, having a main executable in a Main.hs file is obligatory, but you can have source files and load them in GHCi without necessarily having a main block.

## Print to Console from Module

- `print`: Prints to the screen
- `putStrLn`: Prints a **string** to screen and creates a new line.
- `putStr`: Prints a **string** to screen but DOES NOT create a new line.

## Concat Strings

- `++`: `"hello" ++ "world"`
- `concat`: `concat ["hello", "world"]`

## Top-level vs local definitions (i.e., scope)

- Top-level is module level
- Top-level is anything not nested (indented) in something else
- Top-level is available for import to another module
