## 2.3 Understanding expressions

- Everything in Haskell is an expression or declaration.
- Expressions may be:
  - values,
  - combinations of values,
  - and/or functions applied to values.
- _Declarations_ are top level bindings that allow us to name expressions
- Reducible expressions are also called _Redexes_.
- A _function_ is a specific type of expression.

## 2.10 let and where

- _let_ introduces an expression without context
- _where_ is a declaration and is bound to a surrounding syntactic construct.

```haskell
printInc n = print plusTwo
  where plusTwo = n + 2

printInc2 n = let plusTwo = n + 2
              in print plusTwo
```
