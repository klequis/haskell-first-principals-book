# An interesting thing about types & type classes

> Results of :t come with what you entered followed by `::` and then the type. For example `:t sum3` results in: `sum3 :: Num a => a -> a -> a -> a`. Removing the redudant info, `::` and what comes before it, gives `Num a => a -> a -> a -> a`. Only the latter is show below.

Starting with the function:

```Haskell
sum3 x y z = x + y + z
```

## A

```
> :t sum3
Num a => a -> a -> a -> a
```

<p style="margin: 0">Type constraint &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Params & return type</p>
<span style="text-decoration:overline">Num a => &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:overline">a -> a -> a -> a</span><br><br>

Everything to the left of the `=>` is a _type constraint_ and evertying to the right of the `=>` represents the parameters and the return type. In this case, since the constraint says `a` is a `Num`, `sum3` is a function that takes 3 arguments of type `Num` and returns a value of type `Num`.

## B

```
:t sum3 1
Num a => a -> a -> a
```

With 1 as the first argument nothing changes becuse 1 can be any type of `Num`.

## C

```
:t sum3 2.2
Fractional a => a -> a -> a
```

With 2.2, a `Fractional`, as the first argument, the type constraint becomes `Fractional` which means `a` can now only be types that will work with division, which excludes types such as `Int`.

## D

Use (2 :: Int) to cast to an `Int`

:t sum3 (2 :: Int)
Int -> Int -> Int

Here the type constraint has been removed because `Int` is a _concrete type_. Unlike `Num` which can be a variety of types such as float or fractional, `Int` can only be an `Int` and therefore does not need any constraints.
