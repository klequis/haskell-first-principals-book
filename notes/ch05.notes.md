# Chapter 5 - Types

## `->`

`->` is the type constructor for functions in Haskell.

```haskell
fst :: (a, b)    ->    a
         [1]     [2]   [3]
```

1. The first parameter of fst has the type (a, b). Note that the tuple type itself (,) takes two arguments, a and b.
2. The function type, (->), has two parameters. One is (a, b), and one is the result a.
3. The result of the function, which has type a. It’s the same a that was in the tuple (a, b).

- addition takes one numeric argument,
- adds it to a 2nd numeric argument of the same type,
- and returns a numeric value of the same type as a result

## `=>` & `->`

I'm still not sure the difference between `->` & `=>` but it appears that

- `->` is the type constructor
- `=>` is the type class arrow
- Each arrow (`->` is show but `=>` not explicitly excluded) in a type signature represents on argument and one result with the final type being the final result

## Sectioning

The term sectioning specifically refers to the partial application of infix operators, which has a special syntax that allows you to choose whether you’re partially applying the operator to the first or the second argument:

- `2^` is using the `^` operatory and applying 2 to the 1st argument
- `^2` is using the `^` operatory and applying 2 to the 2nd argument
